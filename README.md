# psus
This repository contains code for the probabilistic subset simulation algorithm described in "Subset simulation for probabilistic computer models" (to appear).

All codes are written in MATLAB and as such require at least MATLAB 2016b to run. You will also need to have the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox by MathWorks installed.
I have provided the main code, psus.m, dependencies in the Dependencies folder and some Examples (in that folder).
