## Examples
This folder contains three example problems to try out psus on. 
Two are two dimensional, allowing simple and intuitive visualisations and one is *d*-dimensional to test the generalisation of psus. None of these functions is probabilistic in its nature. The general principle in constructing these examples was to cast the output in the shape of a (location-scale) distribution, and to provide a means for controlling the fidelity of the response, mimicking an iterative solver. The latter is achieved using an input hyperparameter which represents the ``number of iterations'' and must be at least equal to 1.

I will aim to make additions to this space as often as possible.

### The Branin function
### Gaussian mixture
### RP63 - a BBR 2019 challenge problem

#### Contributions
A great contribution to this repo will be more examples, including synthetic (as the ones included) or more realistic ones and especially those that break the algorithm.
